# Book Manager - API

This is the back-end solution for the 'Book Manager' application. It is a Java SpringBoot RESt API application allowing book / author entity management.

## Creation of application

Download an initial application from [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io). You can include any dependencies on initial application creation.

## Keep in mind
- You need to run the 'Database.sql' script into MySQL for database availability
- Configure the 'application.properties' file to respect your individual configuration
